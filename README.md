This is a repository for my Hackaday project here: http://hackaday.io/project/3715-tacs-lucid-dreaming-device

Thanks for checking out my project!
To make everything easier just click the download zip button on the right side of the main page of this repository. 
Then extract everthing to a folder. Next you should be able to view the board and schematic files with KiCad or
you can just view the schematic with the pdf that I included. 

All code that is used in this project will also be posted in this repository and will be updated as I progress through the 
project. 

Also for those wondering RevA (Revision A) is what I am calling the first version of the hardware. It is still a work in 
progress but is almost complete and ready for testing. 

**Disclaimer** - I am not responsible for any damages or injury related to this project
The project is very safe. It is battery powered and has a maximum of about 18v present on the board. Do not attempt to use 
the headset when it is connected to mains (the wall) in any way ex. you are powereing it with the programmer which is connected 
a desktop computer ect.
